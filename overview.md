**[GitSense](https://gitsense.com)**, makes searching, analyzing, and reviewing code and code history in VSTS better.

With GitSense:

* You can search more than 5 branches per repository. With GitSense, you can search any branch, from any repository - in any combination.
* You can search for commits, by more than ids. You can search for commits by title, message, files changed, authors, and much more.
* You can instantly find code changes on any branch, from any repository, with a GitSense diffs search.
* You can search for pull requests, not only by creator, assignee and id.  You can search by files changed, code contributors, target branches, and more.
* You no longer have to jump around, to track and review commits and pull requests from different repositories.  With GitSense, you can review multiple repositories, branches, commits and pull requests, all at once.  

and a lot more. 

Developer or manager, Git novice or expert, GitSense can help you and your team, to work smarter and faster, together

### Browse better

Browse efficiently and communicate more effectively, with advanced GitSense multi-browsing.  Browse and and share multiple repositories, branches, commits and pull/merge requests at once.  Working any other way, will seem antiquated, once you've tried multi-browsing with GitSense.

* Try browsing multiple [repositories](https://public.gitsense.com/insight/github?r=electron/electron::atom/atom::Microsoft/vscode), [branches](https://public.gitsense.com/insight/gitlab?r=gitlab-org/gitlab-ce::gitlab-org/gitlab-ee#b%3Dgitlab%3Agitlab-org%2Fgitlab-ce%3Amaster%3A%3Agitlab%3Agitlab-org%2Fgitlab-ee%3Amaster%26t%3Dcommits), [commits](https://public.gitsense.com/insight/github?r=rails/rails#b%3Dgithub%3Arails%2Frails%3Amaster%26q%3Dcommit%3A13c5aa818e%5E_%5Ecommit%3A65e08da68f%5E_%5Ecommit%3Aaa0865a8f0%26t%3Dchganalysis%26rg%3Dhistory) and [pulls](https://public.gitsense.com/insight/github?r=angular%2Fangular.js%3A%3Aangular%2Fangular#q%3Dpom%3A20196%5E_%5Epom%3A18879%5E_%5Epom%3A16192%5E_%5Estate%3Amerged%5E_%5Estate%3Aopen%26p%3Dipom) at once
